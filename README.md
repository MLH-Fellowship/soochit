# 👩‍⚕️ Soochit 

Not just another medicine reminder.

## 📌 Problem 
* People (like us) are lazy enough to procrastinate setting medicine reminders primarily because they have to do the hard task of manually labelling the reminder, setting the time, and setting the frequency of the medicines.
* It's hard for people to keep a physical folder for their medical prescription history.

## ✨ Solution

Soochit: a fully automated e-prescription tracker and medicine reminder.

* The doctor will write digital prescriptions on our app which will be saved on user's profile.
* We will send out automated reminders for the patients to take their medicines (entirely based off what is written in the prescription.) 

## 🏁 Use Cases

* Patients won't have to set reminders manually. Hence, there is no way for them to procrastinate.
* Patients won't have to keep a physical binder to maintain their medical history.
* Patients won't have to confuse themselves by reading the (mostly incomprehensible) handwriting of the doctor once they forget their medicines, dosage, or timings.

## 👀 Unique Selling Point (USP)
it is a medicine reminder app, but you don't have to set reminders for your medicines. 😉
